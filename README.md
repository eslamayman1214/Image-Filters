# Image-Filters

### This program used to filter images by (Alpha-Trim and Adaptive Median Filters) using different types of sort algorithms (taking the pixels and resorting them using algrothims in order to get the best quality of this picture).
Input :
Alpha-Trim Filter
1.	Window size 
2.	Trim value
3.	Max window size for graph

Adaptive Med Filter
1.	Max window size for the filter (Ws)
2.	Max window size for the graph (Wmax)
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
Implementation:
1.	Alpha-trim filter using two methods:
a.	Counting sort
b.	Select Kth smallest/largest element.

2.	Adaptive median filter using two methods:
a.	Counting sort
b.	Quick sort

3.	Display two graphs (one for the alpha-trim and other for adaptive median) to show the execution time against different window sizes (3, 5, 7,â€¦) of different methods.
